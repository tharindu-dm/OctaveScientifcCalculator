- Angle mode switching (degrees/radians)
- Constants (Ï€, e)
- Parentheses and exponentiation
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MS, MC)
- Backspace and clear functions
- Last answer recall

### Matrix Operations
- Matrix input for matrices A and B
- Matrix operations:
  - Addition (A + B)
  - Subtraction (A - B)
  - Multiplication (A * B)
  - Transpose
  - Switch matrices
